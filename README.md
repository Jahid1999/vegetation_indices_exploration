## Histogram Control

The histogram control provides comprehensive statistics and visualization for NDVI/NDWI image data:

### Features:

- **Statistics Display**: Shows min, mean, and max values for the currently active image
- **Interactive Bar Chart**: Visualizes the distribution of NDVI/NDWI values across the field
- **Color-coded Bars**: Each bar in the histogram uses the same colors as the image overlay
- **Collapsible Interface**: Can be collapsed to save screen space
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Usage:

1. Click on a field to load the polygon boundary
2. Click "Show NDVI" to display the image overlay
3. The histogram control will automatically appear on the left side
4. Use the image type dropdown to switch between different indices (NDVI, NDWI, etc.)
5. The histogram updates automatically when changing image types
6. Click the "‚àí" button to collapse the control

### Data Sources:

- Statistics: `histogram.min`, `histogram.mean`, `histogram.max`
- Chart data: `histogram.items[]` with `valueMin`, `valueMax`, `area`, and `color` properties
- Visualization prioritizes area (hectares) over pixel count for meaningful representation
